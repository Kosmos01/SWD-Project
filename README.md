# SWD-Project

Project for our Spring 2020 Software Design class.

### Description
Create a web portal application for users to create an account with the goal of obtaining a quote for ordering gallons of oil. Depending 
on several factors (user's profile, previous quotes, gallons requested, summer delivery date etc.) we supply the price/gallon and their total amount due. Submitted quotes will be saved in a database and when the users wishes to see their quote history, we will query the database to show their previous quotes.

### Stack
Apache HTTP Server, PHP, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL
